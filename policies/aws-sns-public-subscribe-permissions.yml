      This policy will ensure SNS topics do not have a public Subscribe
      permission via a wildcard in the SNS resource's access policy. Granting
      the public Subscribe permissions puts the SNS topics security at risk as
      any unauthorized user can receive topic messages. Topic permissions should
      be limited only to trusted subscribers. This policy helps with compliance
      standards such as PCI-DSS, NIST, and GDPR by identifying and removing
      these non-compliant permissions.

  description: &description |
      SNS topics which have unauthorized public Subscribe access will be
      identified, the insecure public Subscribe permissions removed, and the
      impacted users will be notified.

  violation-desc: &violation-desc |
      SNS topics should not be made publicly accessible. The identified SNS
      topics access was overly permissive via the SNS topic's access
      policy and the unauthorized public Subscribe permissions have
      automatically been removed.

  action-desc: &action-desc |
      The identified SNS topics public Subscribe access has been removed by
      Cloud Custodian.
