      This policy will ensure EBS volumes with a app-tier identifier tag are
      encrypted so that information on them can be securely stored and accessed.
      App-tier resources should be encrypted to protect from attackers,
      malicious activity, and unauthorized users. This policy helps with
      compliance standards such as APRA, GDPR, HIPAA, MAS, and PCI-DSS by
      identifying the non-compliant non-encrypted EBS volumes.

  description: &description |
      EBS volumes which are tagged as app-tier and not encrypted will
      be identified, encrypted, and the impacted users will be notified.

    "tag:app-tier": present

  violation-desc: &violation-desc |
      EBS volumes tagged as app-tier should be encrypted. The identified volumes
      are tagged as app-tier and are missing encryption which does not meet
      compliance standards.

  action-desc: &action-desc |
      The identified app-tier EBS volumes have been updated to be encrypted.
      Please verify your volumes functionality, as the enabling of encryption can
      affect some client's connectivity.
