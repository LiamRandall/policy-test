      This policy will verify that AWS RDS databases are encrypted to ensure
      proper data security and compliance standards are being met. Encrypting
      sensitive and critical data is recommended to prevent unauthorized access
      to your data. This policy helps with compliance standards such as APRA,
      GDPR, HIPAA, MAS, NIST 800-53 rev4, and PCI DSS by identifying the
      non-compliant RDS databases which are not encrypted and taking an
      appropriate action. Remediation options include deletion of the
      non-compliant databases and a notification sent to the impacted users.
      Encryption cannot be enabled after an RDS database is created.

  description-delete: &description-delete |
      Newly launched RDS databases which are not encrypted will be identified,
      deleted, and the impacted users notified. Encryption cannot be enabled or
      modified after an RDS database is created.

  description-notify: &description-notify |
      RDS databases which are not encrypted will be identified and the impacted
      users notified. Encryption cannot be enabled or modified after an RDS
      database is created. The non-compliant database should be deleted and
      recreated using encryption to ensure it meets encryption requirements for
      compliance regulations.
