      This policy will verify that AWS RDS database clusters are encrypted to
      ensure proper data security and compliance standards are being met.
      Encrypting sensitive and critical data is recommended to prevent
      unauthorized access to your data. This policy helps with compliance
      standards such as APRA, GDPR, HIPAA, MAS, NIST 800-53 rev4, and PCI DSS by
      identifying the non-compliant RDS database clusters which are not
      encrypted and taking an appropriate action. Remediation options include
      deletion of the non-compliant database clusters and a notification sent to
      the impacted users. Encryption cannot be enabled after an RDS database
      cluster is created.

  description-delete: &description-delete |
      Newly launched RDS database clusters which are not encrypted will be
      identified, deleted, and the impacted users notified. Encryption cannot be
      enabled or modified after an RDS database cluster is created.

  description-notify: &description-notify |
      RDS database clusters which are not encrypted will be identified and the
      impacted users notified. Encryption cannot be enabled or modified after an
      RDS database cluster is created. The non-compliant database cluster should
      be deleted and recreated using encryption to ensure it meets encryption
      requirements for compliance regulations.
